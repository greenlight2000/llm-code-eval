For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards.

Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black.

{"description":"A kindergarten teacher Natalia Pavlovna has invented a new ball game. This game not only develops the children's physique, but also teaches them how to count. The game goes as follows. Kids stand in circle. Let's agree to think of the children as numbered with numbers from 1 to n clockwise and the child number 1 is holding the ball. First the first child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child number 2. Then the child number 2 throws the ball to the next but one child, i.e. to the child number 4, then the fourth child throws the ball to the child that stands two children away from him, i.e. to the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 3 children away from the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child who stands 4 children away from the last one, and so on. It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if n\u2009=\u20095, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, n\u2009-\u20091 throws are made, and the game ends.The problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game.

{"description":"After the Search Ultimate program that searched for strings in a text failed, Igor K. got to think: \"Why on Earth does my program work so slowly?\" As he double-checked his code, he said: \"My code contains no errors, yet I know how we will improve Search Ultimate!\" and took a large book from the shelves. The book read \"Azembler. Principally New Approach\".Having carefully thumbed through the book, Igor K. realised that, as it turns out, you can multiply the numbers dozens of times faster. \"Search Ultimate will be faster than it has ever been!\" \u2014 the fellow shouted happily and set to work.Let us now clarify what Igor's idea was. The thing is that the code that was generated by a compiler was far from perfect. Standard multiplying does work slower than with the trick the book mentioned.The Azembler language operates with 26 registers (eax, ebx, ..., ezx) and two commands:   [x] \u2014 returns the value located in the address x. For example, [eax] returns the value that was located in the address, equal to the value in the register eax.  lea x, y \u2014 assigns to the register x, indicated as the first operand, the second operand's address. Thus, for example, the \"lea ebx, [eax]\" command will write in the ebx register the content of the eax register: first the [eax] operation will be fulfilled, the result of it will be some value that lies in the address written in eax. But we do not need the value \u2014 the next operation will be lea, that will take the [eax] address, i.e., the value in the eax register, and will write it in ebx. On the first thought the second operation seems meaningless, but as it turns out, it is acceptable to write the operation as lea ecx, [eax + ebx],lea ecx, [k*eax]or evenlea ecx, [ebx + k*eax],where k = 1, 2, 4 or 8.As a result, the register ecx will be equal to the numbers eax + ebx, k*eax and ebx + k*eax correspondingly. However, such operation is fulfilled many times, dozens of times faster that the usual multiplying of numbers. And using several such operations, one can very quickly multiply some number by some other one. Of course, instead of eax, ebx and ecx you are allowed to use any registers.For example, let the eax register contain some number that we should multiply by 41. It takes us 2 lines:lea ebx, [eax + 4*eax] \/\/ now ebx = 5*eaxlea eax, [eax + 8*ebx] \/\/ now eax = eax + 8*ebx = 41*eaxIgor K. got interested in the following question: what is the minimum number of lea operations needed to multiply by the given number n and how to do it? Your task is to help him.Consider that at the initial moment of time eax contains a number that Igor K. was about to multiply by n, and the registers from ebx to ezx contain number 0. At the final moment of time the result can be located in any register.","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","input_spec":"The input data contain the only integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009255), which Igor K. is about to multiply.","output_spec":"On the first line print number p, which represents the minimum number of lea operations, needed to do that.

{"description":"Not long ago Billy came across such a problem, where there were given three natural numbers A, B and C from the range [1,\u2009N], and it was asked to check whether the equation AB\u2009=\u2009C is correct.

{"description":"There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations:   alloc n \u2014 to allocate n bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier x;  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier x;  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of m bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the m-th.The first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of n successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.The second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.The last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.In the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.You are to write the implementation of the memory manager.

{"description":"Piet is one of the most known visual esoteric programming languages. The programs in Piet are constructed from colorful blocks of pixels and interpreted using pretty complicated rules. In this problem we will use a subset of Piet language with simplified rules.The program will be a rectangular image consisting of colored and black pixels. The color of each pixel will be given by an integer number between 0 and 9, inclusive, with 0 denoting black. A block of pixels is defined as a rectangle of pixels of the same color (not black). It is guaranteed that all connected groups of colored pixels of the same color will form rectangular blocks. Groups of black pixels can form arbitrary shapes.The program is interpreted using movement of instruction pointer (IP) which consists of three parts: current block pointer (BP); note that there is no concept of current pixel within the block; direction pointer (DP) which can point left, right, up or down; block chooser (CP) which can point to the left or to the right from the direction given by DP; in absolute values CP can differ from DP by 90 degrees counterclockwise or clockwise, respectively.Initially BP points to the block which contains the top-left corner of the program, DP points to the right, and CP points to the left (see the orange square on the image below).One step of program interpretation changes the state of IP in a following way. The interpreter finds the furthest edge of the current color block in the direction of the DP. From all pixels that form this edge, the interpreter selects the furthest one in the direction of CP. After this, BP attempts to move from this pixel into the next one in the direction of DP. If the next pixel belongs to a colored block, this block becomes the current one, and two other parts of IP stay the same. It the next pixel is black or outside of the program, BP stays the same but two other parts of IP change. If CP was pointing to the left, now it points to the right, and DP stays the same. If CP was pointing to the right, now it points to the left, and DP is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.This way BP will never point to a black block (it is guaranteed that top-left pixel of the program will not be black).You are given a Piet program.

Petrol stations are located on the motorway at an interval of 100 kilometers, i.e. the first station is located 100 kilometers away from the city A, the second one is 200 kilometers away from the city A, the third one is 300 kilometers away from the city A and so on. The Huff-puffer spends 10 liters of petrol every 100 kilometers. Vanya checks the petrol tank every time he passes by a petrol station. If the petrol left in the tank is not enough to get to the next station, Vanya fills the tank with \u03b1 liters of petrol. Otherwise, he doesn't stop at the station and drives on. For example, if \u03b1\u2009=\u200943.21, then the car will be fuelled up for the first time at the station number 4, when there'll be 3.21 petrol liters left. After the fuelling up the car will have 46.42 liters. Then Vanya stops at the station number 8 and ends up with 6.42\u2009+\u200943.21\u2009=\u200949.63 liters.

With probability 1\u2009-\u2009pi he equiprobably choose one of the adjacent rooms and went there along the corridor. Here i is the ordinal number of the current room. Building was expensive in ancient times, that's why each corridor connected two different rooms, and any two rooms had no more than one corridor between them. The boys act simultaneously. As the corridors are dark, it is impossible to meet there; however, one can walk along the corridors in both directions (besides, the two boys can be going through the same corridor simultaneously without meeting). The boys act like that until they meet each other. More formally, the two friends meet when at some moment of time both of them decided to appear in the same room.For each room find the probability that the boys will meet there considering that at 6 p.m. they are positioned in rooms a and b correspondingly.","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","input_spec":"The first line contains four integers: n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u200922), representing the numbers of rooms; m , representing the number of corridors; a,\u2009b (1\u2009\u2264\u2009a,\u2009b\u2009\u2264\u2009n), representing the numbers of Petya's and Vasya's starting rooms correspondingly.

{"description":"Vera adores poems. All the poems Vera knows are divided into quatrains (groups of four lines) and in each quatrain some lines contain rhymes.Let's consider that all lines in the poems consist of lowercase Latin letters (without spaces). Letters \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\" are considered vowels.Two lines rhyme if their suffixes that start from the k-th vowels (counting from the end) match. If a line has less than k vowels, then such line can't rhyme with any other line. For example, if k\u2009=\u20091, lines commit and hermit rhyme (the corresponding suffixes equal it), and if k\u2009=\u20092, they do not rhyme (ommit\u2009\u2260\u2009ermit).Today on a literature lesson Vera learned that quatrains can contain four different schemes of rhymes, namely the following ones (the same letters stand for rhyming lines):   Clerihew (aabb);  Alternating (abab);  Enclosed (abba). If all lines of a quatrain pairwise rhyme, then the quatrain can belong to any rhyme scheme (this situation is represented by aaaa).If all quatrains of a poem belong to the same rhyme scheme, then we can assume that the whole poem belongs to this rhyme scheme.

{"description":"Piet is one of the most known visual esoteric programming languages. The programs in Piet are constructed from colorful blocks of pixels and interpreted using pretty complicated rules. In this problem we will use a subset of Piet language with simplified rules.The program will be a rectangular image consisting of colored and black pixels. The color of each pixel will be given by an integer number between 0 and 9, inclusive, with 0 denoting black. A block of pixels is defined as a rectangle of pixels of the same color (not black). It is guaranteed that all connected groups of colored pixels of the same color will form rectangular blocks. Groups of black pixels can form arbitrary shapes.The program is interpreted using movement of instruction pointer (IP) which consists of three parts: current block pointer (BP); note that there is no concept of current pixel within the block; direction pointer (DP) which can point left, right, up or down; block chooser (CP) which can point to the left or to the right from the direction given by DP; in absolute values CP can differ from DP by 90 degrees counterclockwise or clockwise, respectively.Initially BP points to the block which contains the top-left corner of the program, DP points to the right, and CP points to the left (see the orange square on the image below).One step of program interpretation changes the state of IP in a following way. The interpreter finds the furthest edge of the current color block in the direction of the DP. From all pixels that form this edge, the interpreter selects the furthest one in the direction of CP. After this, BP attempts to move from this pixel into the next one in the direction of DP. If the next pixel belongs to a colored block, this block becomes the current one, and two other parts of IP stay the same. It the next pixel is black or outside of the program, BP stays the same but two other parts of IP change. If CP was pointing to the left, now it points to the right, and DP stays the same. If CP was pointing to the right, now it points to the left, and DP is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.This way BP will never point to a black block (it is guaranteed that top-left pixel of the program will not be black).You are given a Piet program.

{"description":"Most C\/C++ programmers know about excellent opportunities that preprocessor #define directives give; but many know as well about the problems that can arise because of their careless use.In this problem we consider the following model of #define constructions (also called macros). Each macro has its name and value. The generic syntax for declaring a macro is the following:#define macro_name macro_valueAfter the macro has been declared, \"macro_name\" is replaced with \"macro_value\" each time it is met in the program (only the whole tokens can be replaced; i.e. \"macro_name\" is replaced only when it is surrounded by spaces or other non-alphabetic symbol). A \"macro_value\" within our model can only be an arithmetic expression consisting of variables, four arithmetic operations, brackets, and also the names of previously declared macros (in this case replacement is performed sequentially). The process of replacing macros with their values is called substitution.One of the main problems arising while using macros \u2014 the situation when as a result of substitution we get an arithmetic expression with the changed order of calculation because of different priorities of the operations.Let's consider the following example. Say, we declared such a #define construction:#define sum x + yand further in the program the expression \"2 * sum\" is calculated. After macro substitution is performed we get \"2 * x + y\", instead of intuitively expected \"2 * (x + y)\".Let's call the situation \"suspicious\", if after the macro substitution the order of calculation changes, falling outside the bounds of some macro. Thus, your task is to find out by the given set of #define definitions and the given expression if this expression is suspicious or not.Let's speak more formally. We should perform an ordinary macros substitution in the given expression. Moreover, we should perform a \"safe\" macros substitution in the expression, putting in brackets each macro value; after this, guided by arithmetic rules of brackets expansion, we can omit some of the brackets. If there exist a way to get an expression, absolutely coinciding with the expression that is the result of an ordinary substitution (character-by-character, but ignoring spaces), then this expression and the macros system are called correct, otherwise \u2014 suspicious.Note that we consider the \"\/\" operation as the usual mathematical division, not the integer division like in C\/C++. That's why, for example, in the expression \"a*(b\/c)\" we can omit brackets to get the expression \"a*b\/c\".","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","input_spec":"The first line contains the only number n (0\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 the amount of #define constructions in the given program. Then there follow n lines, each of them contains just one #define construction.

An expression is a non-empty string, containing digits,names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets and operational signs +-*\/. It is guaranteed that the expression (before and after macros substitution) is a correct arithmetic expression, having no unary operations. The expression contains only non-negative integers, not exceeding 109.  All the names (#define constructions' names and names of their arguments) are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters.

The big array will be given as an array of indexes (1-based) of the small arrays, and the concatenation should be done in the same order as in this array.

Letters \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\" are considered vowels.Two lines rhyme if their suffixes that start from the k-th vowels (counting from the end) match. If a line has less than k vowels, then such line can't rhyme with any other line.

To be absolutely sure in the cows' safety, Vasya wants the path completion time to be minimum.The new game is launched for different devices, including mobile phones. That's why the developers decided to quit using the arithmetics with the floating decimal point and use only the arithmetics of integers.

After a participant earns a certain number of points, he can come to the prize distribution center and exchange the points for prizes. When somebody takes a prize, the prize's cost is simply subtracted from the number of his points.Vasya didn't only bought the bars, he also kept a record of how many points each wrapping cost. Also, he remembers that he always stucks to the greedy strategy \u2014 as soon as he could take at least one prize, he went to the prize distribution centre and exchanged the points for prizes. Moreover, if he could choose between multiple prizes, he chose the most expensive one. If after an exchange Vasya had enough points left to get at least one more prize, then he continued to exchange points.The sweepstake has the following prizes (the prizes are sorted by increasing of their cost):   a mug (costs a points),  a towel (costs b points),  a bag (costs c points),  a bicycle (costs d points),  a car (costs e points).

{"description":"Vera adores poems. All the poems Vera knows are divided into quatrains (groups of four lines) and in each quatrain some lines contain rhymes.Let's consider that all lines in the poems consist of lowercase Latin letters (without spaces). Letters \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\" are considered vowels.Two lines rhyme if their suffixes that start from the k-th vowels (counting from the end) match. If a line has less than k vowels, then such line can't rhyme with any other line. For example, if k\u2009=\u20091, lines commit and hermit rhyme (the corresponding suffixes equal it), and if k\u2009=\u20092, they do not rhyme (ommit\u2009\u2260\u2009ermit).Today on a literature lesson Vera learned that quatrains can contain four different schemes of rhymes, namely the following ones (the same letters stand for rhyming lines):   Clerihew (aabb);  Alternating (abab);  Enclosed (abba). If all lines of a quatrain pairwise rhyme, then the quatrain can belong to any rhyme scheme (this situation is represented by aaaa).If all quatrains of a poem belong to the same rhyme scheme, then we can assume that the whole poem belongs to this rhyme scheme. If in each quatrain all lines pairwise rhyme, then the rhyme scheme of the poem is aaaa. Let us note that it doesn't matter whether lines from different quatrains rhyme with each other or not.

{"description":"There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations:   alloc n \u2014 to allocate n bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier x;  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier x;  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of m bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the m-th.The first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of n successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.The second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.The last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.In the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.You are to write the implementation of the memory manager.

After the fuelling up the car will have 46.42 liters. Then Vanya stops at the station number 8 and ends up with 6.42\u2009+\u200943.21\u2009=\u200949.63 liters. The next stop is at the station number 12, 9.63\u2009+\u200943.21\u2009=\u200952.84. The next stop is at the station number 17 and so on. You won't believe this but the Huff-puffer has been leading in the race! Perhaps it is due to unexpected snow. Perhaps it is due to video cameras that have been installed along the motorway which register speed limit breaking. Perhaps it is due to the fact that Vanya threatened to junk the Huff-puffer unless the car wins. Whatever the reason is, the Huff-puffer is leading, and jealous people together with other contestants wrack their brains trying to think of a way to stop that outrage.One way to do this is to mine the next petrol station where Vanya will stop. Your task is to calculate at which station this will happen and warn Vanya.

The only difference is that when a billiard ball hits the board's border, it can reflect from it and continue moving.More formally, first one of four diagonal directions is chosen and the billiard ball moves in that direction. When it reaches the square located on the board's edge, the billiard ball reflects from it; it changes the direction of its movement by 90 degrees and continues moving. Specifically, having reached a corner square, the billiard ball is reflected twice and starts to move the opposite way. While it moves, the billiard ball can make an infinite number of reflections. At any square of its trajectory the billiard ball can stop and on that the move is considered completed.

The big array will be given as an array of indexes (1-based) of the small arrays, and the concatenation should be done in the same order as in this array.

{"description":"There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations:   alloc n \u2014 to allocate n bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier x;  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier x;  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of m bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the m-th.The first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of n successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.The second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.The last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.In the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.You are to write the implementation of the memory manager.

Different character classes are characterized by different skills. Unfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given character's class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this limitation, there is the so-called transmigration. Transmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his experience from the previous life. As a result of transmigration the new character gets all the skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced according to the k coefficient (if the skill level was equal to x, then after transmigration it becomes equal to [kx], where [y] is the integral part of y). If some skill's levels are strictly less than 100, these skills are forgotten (the character does not have them any more). After that the new character also gains the skills that are specific for his class, but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set to 0. Thus, one can create a character with skills specific for completely different character classes via transmigrations. For example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible.

{"description":"There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations:   alloc n \u2014 to allocate n bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier x;  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier x;  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of m bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the m-th.The first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of n successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.The second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.The last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.In the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.You are to write the implementation of the memory manager.

{"description":"Most C\/C++ programmers know about excellent opportunities that preprocessor #define directives give; but many know as well about the problems that can arise because of their careless use.In this problem we consider the following model of #define constructions (also called macros). Each macro has its name and value. The generic syntax for declaring a macro is the following:#define macro_name macro_valueAfter the macro has been declared, \"macro_name\" is replaced with \"macro_value\" each time it is met in the program (only the whole tokens can be replaced; i.e. \"macro_name\" is replaced only when it is surrounded by spaces or other non-alphabetic symbol). A \"macro_value\" within our model can only be an arithmetic expression consisting of variables, four arithmetic operations, brackets, and also the names of previously declared macros (in this case replacement is performed sequentially). The process of replacing macros with their values is called substitution.One of the main problems arising while using macros \u2014 the situation when as a result of substitution we get an arithmetic expression with the changed order of calculation because of different priorities of the operations.Let's consider the following example. Say, we declared such a #define construction:#define sum x + yand further in the program the expression \"2 * sum\" is calculated. After macro substitution is performed we get \"2 * x + y\", instead of intuitively expected \"2 * (x + y)\".Let's call the situation \"suspicious\", if after the macro substitution the order of calculation changes, falling outside the bounds of some macro. Thus, your task is to find out by the given set of #define definitions and the given expression if this expression is suspicious or not.Let's speak more formally. We should perform an ordinary macros substitution in the given expression. Moreover, we should perform a \"safe\" macros substitution in the expression, putting in brackets each macro value; after this, guided by arithmetic rules of brackets expansion, we can omit some of the brackets. If there exist a way to get an expression, absolutely coinciding with the expression that is the result of an ordinary substitution (character-by-character, but ignoring spaces), then this expression and the macros system are called correct, otherwise \u2014 suspicious.Note that we consider the \"\/\" operation as the usual mathematical division, not the integer division like in C\/C++.

{"description":"Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second half.For example, ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is 2>1 and 4>2), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is 0<3 and 1<5), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion.

Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: \u03c0(n)\u00a0\u2014 the number of primes no larger than n, rub(n)\u00a0\u2014 the number of palindromic numbers no larger than n. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones.He asked you to solve the following problem: for a given value of the coefficient A find the maximum n, such that \u03c0(n)\u2009\u2264\u2009A\u00b7rub(n).","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","input_spec":"The input consists of two positive integers p, q, the numerator and denominator of the fraction that is the value of A\u00a0(,\u00a0).","output_spec":"If such maximum number exists, then print it.

{"description":"As you know, Vova has recently become a new shaman in the city of Ultima Thule. So, he has received the shaman knowledge about the correct bracket sequences. The shamans of Ultima Thule have been using lots of different types of brackets since prehistoric times. A bracket type is a positive integer. The shamans define a correct bracket sequence as follows:  An empty sequence is a correct bracket sequence.  If {a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009al} and {b1,\u2009b2,\u2009...,\u2009bk} are correct bracket sequences, then sequence {a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009al,\u2009b1,\u2009b2,\u2009...,\u2009bk} (their concatenation) also is a correct bracket sequence.  If {a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009al} \u2014 is a correct bracket sequence, then sequence  also is a correct bracket sequence, where v (v\u2009&gt;\u20090) is an integer. For example, sequences {1,\u20091,\u2009\u2009-\u20091,\u20092,\u2009\u2009-\u20092,\u2009\u2009-\u20091} and {3,\u2009\u2009-\u20093} are correct bracket sequences, and {2,\u2009\u2009-\u20093} is not.Moreover, after Vova became a shaman, he learned the most important correct bracket sequence {x1,\u2009x2,\u2009...,\u2009xn}, consisting of n integers. As sequence x is the most important, Vova decided to encrypt it just in case.Encrypting consists of two sequences. The first sequence {p1,\u2009p2,\u2009...,\u2009pn} contains types of brackets, that is, pi\u2009=\u2009|xi| (1\u2009\u2264\u2009i\u2009\u2264\u2009n).

But he was lucky enough to keep the encryption: sequences {p1,\u2009p2,\u2009...,\u2009pn} and {q1,\u2009q2,\u2009...,\u2009qt}. Help Vova restore sequence x by the encryption.

This year Vanya decided to take part in the race and drive his own car that has been around and bears its own noble name \u2014 The Huff-puffer.So, Vasya leaves city A on the Huff-puffer, besides, at the very beginning he fills the petrol tank with \u03b1 liters of petrol (\u03b1\u2009\u2265\u200910 is Vanya's favorite number, it is not necessarily integer). Petrol stations are located on the motorway at an interval of 100 kilometers, i.e. the first station is located 100 kilometers away from the city A, the second one is 200 kilometers away from the city A, the third one is 300 kilometers away from the city A and so on. The Huff-puffer spends 10 liters of petrol every 100 kilometers. Vanya checks the petrol tank every time he passes by a petrol station. If the petrol left in the tank is not enough to get to the next station, Vanya fills the tank with \u03b1 liters of petrol. Otherwise, he doesn't stop at the station and drives on. For example, if \u03b1\u2009=\u200943.21, then the car will be fuelled up for the first time at the station number 4, when there'll be 3.21 petrol liters left. After the fuelling up the car will have 46.42 liters. Then Vanya stops at the station number 8 and ends up with 6.42\u2009+\u200943.21\u2009=\u200949.63 liters. The next stop is at the station number 12, 9.63\u2009+\u200943.21\u2009=\u200952.84. The next stop is at the station number 17 and so on. You won't believe this but the Huff-puffer has been leading in the race! Perhaps it is due to unexpected snow. Perhaps it is due to video cameras that have been installed along the motorway which register speed limit breaking. Perhaps it is due to the fact that Vanya threatened to junk the Huff-puffer unless the car wins.

{"description":"For some time the program of rounding numbers that had been developed by the Codeforces participants during one of the previous rounds, helped the citizens of Far Far Away to convert numbers into a more easily readable format. However, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.The King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows:   A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point).  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678  In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests).  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets.  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes ($), that's why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\". If the number should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be inside the brackets. For example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored in the financial format as \"$2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be stored as \"($12,345,678.90)\".The merchants of Far Far Away visited you again and expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert arbitrary numbers to the financial format.

Letters \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\" are considered vowels.Two lines rhyme if their suffixes that start from the k-th vowels (counting from the end) match. If a line has less than k vowels, then such line can't rhyme with any other line.

According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations:   alloc n \u2014 to allocate n bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier x;  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier x;  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of m bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the m-th.The first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of n successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.The second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.The last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.In the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers.

One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".For a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).It turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. Unhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative.

The first row has n scales, the second row has (n-1) scales, the i-th row has (n-i+1) scales, the last row has exactly one scale. Let's number the scales in each row from the left to the right, starting from 1. Then the value of wi,k in kilograms (1\u2264i\u2264n;\u00a01\u2264k\u2264n-i+1) is the weight capacity parameter of the k-th scale in the i-th row. If a body whose mass is not less than wi,k falls on the scale with weight capacity wi,k, then the scale breaks. At that anything that the scale has on it, either falls one level down to the left (if possible) or one level down to the right (if possible). In other words, if the scale wi,k (i<n) breaks, then there are at most two possible variants in which the contents of the scale's pan can fall out: all contents of scale wi,k falls either on scale wi+1,k-1 (if it exists), or on scale wi+1,k (if it exists).

In large electronic sports competitions where Kostya's team is going to participate, the matches are held in the Captains Mode. In this mode the captains select the heroes by making one of two possible actions in a certain, predetermined order: pick or ban.  To pick a hero for the team. After the captain picks, the picked hero goes to his team (later one of a team members will play it) and can no longer be selected by any of the teams.  To ban a hero. After the ban the hero is not sent to any of the teams, but it still can no longer be selected by any of the teams. The team captain may miss a pick or a ban. If he misses a pick, a random hero is added to his team from those that were available at that moment, and if he misses a ban, no hero is banned, as if there was no ban.Kostya has already identified the strength of all the heroes based on the new patch fixes.

{"description":"Alas, finding one's true love is not easy. Masha has been unsuccessful in that yet. Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of one's Prince Charming through arithmancy. The phone number is divined like that. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example, let's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will be the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit is 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Masha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's number. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2+9)\/2=5.5. Masha can round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she chooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way, i.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number. The result is (5+3)\/2=4. In this case the answer is unique. Thus, every i-th digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the i-th digit of Masha's number and the i-1-th digit of her true love's number. If needed, the digit can be rounded up or down. For example, Masha can get: 12345 95444 Unfortunately, when Masha tried dialing the number, she got disappointed: as it turned out, the number was unavailable or outside the coverage area. But Masha won't give up. Perhaps, she rounded to a wrong digit or chose the first digit badly. That's why she keeps finding more and more new numbers and calling them.

{"description":"Julia is conducting an experiment in her lab. She placed several luminescent bacterial colonies in a horizontal testtube. Different types of bacteria can be distinguished by the color of light they emit. Julia marks types of bacteria with small Latin letters \"a\", ..., \"z\".The testtube is divided into n consecutive regions. Each region is occupied by a single colony of a certain bacteria type at any given moment. Hence, the population of the testtube at any moment can be described by a string of n Latin characters.Sometimes a colony can decide to conquer another colony in one of the adjacent regions. When that happens, the attacked colony is immediately eliminated and replaced by a colony of the same type as the attacking colony, while the attacking colony keeps its type. Note that a colony can only attack its neighbours within the boundaries of the testtube. At any moment, at most one attack can take place.For example, consider a testtube with population \"babb\".

{"description":"Sherlock Holmes found a mysterious correspondence of two VIPs and made up his mind to read it. But there is a problem! The correspondence turned out to be encrypted. The detective tried really hard to decipher the correspondence, but he couldn't understand anything. At last, after some thought, he thought of something. Let's say there is a word s, consisting of |s| lowercase Latin letters. Then for one operation you can choose a certain position p (1\u2264p<|s|) and perform one of the following actions:   either replace letter sp with the one that alphabetically follows it and replace letter sp+1 with the one that alphabetically precedes it;  or replace letter sp with the one that alphabetically precedes it and replace letter sp+1 with the one that alphabetically follows it. Let us note that letter \"z\" doesn't have a defined following letter and letter \"a\" doesn't have a defined preceding letter. That's why the corresponding changes are not acceptable. If the operation requires performing at least one unacceptable change, then such operation cannot be performed.Two words coincide in their meaning iff one of them can be transformed into the other one as a result of zero or more operations.Sherlock Holmes needs to learn to quickly determine the following for each word: how many words can exist that coincide in their meaning with the given word, but differs from the given word in at least one character? Count this number for him modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","input_spec":"The input data contains several tests.

Each word consists of lowercase Latin letters and has length from 1 to 100, inclusive. Lengths of words can differ.\n","output_spec":"For each word you should print the number of different other words that coincide with it in their meaning \u2014 not from the words listed in the input data, but from all possible words. As the sought number can be very large, print its value modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).\n","notes":"Some explanations about the operation:\n  Note that for each letter, we can clearly define the letter that follows it. Letter \"b\" alphabetically follows letter \"a\", letter \"c\" follows letter \"b\", ..., \"z\" follows letter \"y\".  Preceding letters are defined in the similar manner: letter \"y\" precedes letter \"z\", ..., \"a\" precedes letter \"b\".  Note that the operation never changes a word's length. In the first sample you can obtain the only other word \"ba\". In the second sample you cannot obtain any other word, so the correct answer is 0.\nConsider the third sample. One operation can transform word \"klmbfxzb\" into word \"klmcexzb\": we should choose p=4, and replace the fourth letter with the following one (\"b\" \u2192 \"c\"), and the fifth one \u2014 with the preceding one (\"f\" \u2192 \"e\"). Also, we can obtain many other words from this one. An operation can transform word \"ya\" only into one other word \"xb\". \nWord \"ya\" coincides in its meaning with words \"xb\", \"wc\", \"vd\", ..., \"ay\" (overall there are 24 other words). The word \"klmbfxzb has many more variants \u2014 there are 3320092814 other words that coincide with in the meaning.

{"description":"In some country live wizards. They love to ride trolleybuses.A city in this country has a trolleybus depot with n trolleybuses. Every day the trolleybuses leave the depot, one by one and go to the final station. The final station is at a distance of d meters from the depot. We know for the i-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of time ti seconds, can go at a speed of no greater than vi meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than a meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys.Despite the magic the trolleys are still powered by an electric circuit and cannot overtake each other (the wires are to blame, of course). If a trolleybus catches up with another one, they go together one right after the other until they arrive at the final station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.You, as head of the trolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine for each trolley the minimum time by which it can reach the final station. At the time of arrival at the destination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero.

{"description":"Vasya is developing his own programming language VPL (Vasya Programming Language). Right now he is busy making the system of exceptions. He thinks that the system of exceptions must function like that.The exceptions are processed by try-catch-blocks. There are two operators that work with the blocks: The try operator. It opens a new try-catch-block.  The catch(<exception_type>, <message>) operator. It closes the try-catch-block that was started last and haven't yet been closed. This block can be activated only via exception of type <exception_type>. When we activate this block, the screen displays the <message>. If at the given moment there is no open try-catch-block, then we can't use the catch operator.The exceptions can occur in the program in only one case: when we use the throw operator. The throw(<exception_type>) operator creates the exception of the given type.Let's suggest that as a result of using some throw operator the program created an exception of type a. In this case a try-catch-block is activated, such that this block's try operator was described in the program earlier than the used throw operator. Also, this block's catch operator was given an exception type a as a parameter and this block's catch operator is described later that the used throw operator. If there are several such try-catch-blocks, then the system activates the block whose catch operator occurs earlier than others. If no try-catch-block was activated, then the screen displays message \"Unhandled Exception\".To test the system, Vasya wrote a program that contains only try, catch and throw operators, one line contains no more than one operator, the whole program contains exactly one throw operator.Your task is: given a program in VPL, determine, what message will be displayed on the screen.","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","input_spec":"The first line contains a single integer: n (1\u2264n\u226410^5) the number of lines in the program.

Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1,000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","input_spec":"The first line contains two integers a and b (2\u2264a,b\u226425).

He justly thought that, if the regular Olympic games have five rings, then the Special ones will do with exactly two rings just fine.Let us remind you that a ring is a region located between two concentric circles with radii r and R (r<R). These radii are called internal and external, respectively. Concentric circles are circles with centers located at the same point.Soon a white canvas, which can be considered as an infinite Cartesian plane, had two perfect rings, painted with solid black paint. As Sasha is very impulsive, the rings could have different radii and sizes, they intersect and overlap with each other in any way. We know only one thing for sure: the centers of the pair of rings are not the same.When Sasha got tired and fell into a deep sleep, a girl called Ilona came into the room and wanted to cut a circle for the sake of good memories. To make the circle beautiful, she decided to cut along the contour.We'll consider a contour to be a continuous closed line through which there is transition from one color to another (see notes for clarification).

As it usually happens, the cashier said he was going to be away for 5 minutes and left for an hour. Then Vasya, not to get bored, started to analyze such a mechanism as a queue. The findings astonished Vasya.Every man is characterized by two numbers: ai, which is the importance of his current task (the greater the number is, the more important the task is) and number ci, which is a picture of his conscience.

First, he stands at the end of the queue and the does the following: if importance of the task ai of the man in front of him is less than an, they swap their places (it looks like this: the man number n asks the one before him: \"Erm... Excuse me please but it's very important for me... could you please let me move up the queue?\"), then he again poses the question to the man in front of him and so on. But in case when ai is greater than an, moving up the queue stops. However, the man number n can perform the operation no more than cn times.In our task let us suppose that by the moment when the man number n joins the queue, the process of swaps between n-1 will have stopped.
